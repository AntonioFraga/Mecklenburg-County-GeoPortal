# GeoPortal v3

Created by Mecklenburg County GIS. Online [over here](http://mcmap.org/geoportal/).

Built using:

* Material Design Lite
* Mapbox GL JS
* React

## Building the Project

First, install the project dependencies.

``` bash
npm install
```

Then build the public folder.

``` bash
npm run build
```

Now you can launch a development environment at any time by typing:

``` bash
npm start
```

 To build the app for deployment (minifying CSS and uglifying JS), run the build again:

``` bash
npm run build
```
