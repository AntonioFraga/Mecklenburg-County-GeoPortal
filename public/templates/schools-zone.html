                    Transportation eligibility is determined by the transportation zone in which you live. The county is divided into four transportation zones:  violet, grey, blue, and green. Magnet schools are assigned a zone to serve with transportation. If the distance is to the magnet greater than 5 miles, you may be assigned to a shuttle stop location. Some programs (*) provide county-wide transportation, meaning that regardless of your zone, you would receive transportation. For more information please contact Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Transportation Services at (980) 343-6715.
